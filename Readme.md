# My first game

I dreamt of building a game for a while now, so this is me learning to build a game.

This is mostly based on the [Dodge the creeps godot tutorial](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html) with some changes from my side, to learn more stuff.

## Things I changed
- Replaced the tutorial sprites with sprites I build myself (it's dodge the ants now!)
